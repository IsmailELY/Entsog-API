# Entsog API Tracker

## Quick overview of Entso-g
European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas is a non-profit association whose role is to facilitate and enhance cooperation between national gas transmission system operators (TSOs) across Europe.
It does that by providing regular information on gas supply and demand for the European market and delivering common operational tools to ensure network security and reliability.

## Context
This project is part of a personal project that aims to create a big data solution able to analyze public data published by Entsog via their API. 

### What to look forward to?
* A solution that can function manually or configured to retrieve data automatically
* Ability to consume Enstog API moderately (with respect to API guideline)
* Ability to load data for large unsupported queries 
* Automatic Mode: A solution ready to deploy to intercept and collect data  
* Automatic Mode: The ability to send collected data via a private tunels across the network

### Current Progress
The project has just been initiated and does not provide any of the expected functionality.
Stay tuned for future updates !!!
