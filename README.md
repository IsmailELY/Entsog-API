# Entsog API Tracker

## Quick overview of Entso-g
European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas is a non-profit association whose role is to facilitate and enhance cooperation between national gas transmission system operators (TSOs) across Europe.
It does that by providing regular information on gas supply and demand for the European market and delivering common operational tools to ensure network security and reliability.

## Context
This project is part of a personal initiative to develop a simplified code for consuming data from Entsog via their transparency platform API.

### Current Progress
The project has just been initiated and does not provide any of the expected functionality.
Stay tuned for future updates !!!
